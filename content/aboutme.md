### The presentation

Hi! I'm Carlos. A Software Engineer from Madrid. This blog is just an excuse to keep track of some
things I do.

I have always felt a non-ending curiosity for many different subjects. That thirst of
knowledge is what has mainly driven my personal, academic and professional career and was the cause
that made me study Industrial Engineering to learn what made things work. After finishing my studies,
I started working as a C++ Software Developer in a Research Centre at the Polytechnic University of
Madrid. Also, while working there, I had the opportunity to make a Ph.D. in the field of photometric
and geometric adjustment of multi-projector systems. I also like to do projects on my own when I have
some time.


### The adventure

In late 2015, motivated by my love for cooking, I decided to give my career a new twist co-founding
a restaurant in which I wanted to test a set of modern cooking techniques that had arisen in the last
few years. My intention was creating an industrial high-quality easily-scalable food production line.
During this time, I had to use my engineering skills to organize a team and also continuously optimize
working processes to create value for our customers. These efforts were successful, my business partner and I could position [”The Big Banh”](http://www.thebigbanh.com/) in the top of the Street Food restaurant scene in Madrid with hundreds of highly-positive reviews by our clients.

### Back to the future

After more than three years of adventure, I decided to take a new path and joined the amazing Conan
C/C++ Package manager team in JFrog where I'm happily working now. Conan fits a vital need in the C++
community, the need of managing dependencies easily. There is a [central
repository](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) where the community is making a great
effort in adding new libraries each day. To this date (January 2021) [this is how the hierarchy of
libraries looks in Conan Center](../c3i-graph.html).
